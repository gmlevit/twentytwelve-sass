# Twentytwelve SASS Child Theme
### Sample Twentytwelve child theme using SASS.

Demo code used for the WordPress NYC Meetup Presentation on 3/18/2014:

[Better WordPress Style: Using SASS & LESS CSS Preprocessors](http://www.meetup.com/WordPressNYC/events/169583212/)

Yes, it's a 90s style theme, complete with gradients and box shadows, in lovely shades of green. :)

  
The style is identical to the Twentytwelve LESS Child Theme

## Initial Commit
Style.css is only here to register the child theme with WordPress. Already enqueued in functions.php


All SASS .scss files are located in /sass/

Feedback and pull requests are definitely welcome. Do something awesome with it and have fun!
